# Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

To keep the option of dual-licensing (AGPL for the community + a separate commercial license), **all contributions require a signed CLA**.

By submitting a pull request, you agree that:

1. You have the right to grant the copyright license below.
2. You grant the project owner a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly perform, publicly display, and sublicense your contribution, including under different license terms (including proprietary/commercial terms).

If you cannot agree to this, please do not submit code contributions. You can still:

- Open issues
- Provide benchmarks and bug reports
- Share usage feedback
